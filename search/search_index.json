Color spaces are mathematical models describing the way colors can be represented. The easiest way of visualising them is to think of a box containing all the possible colors that can be produced by mixing the three primary colors of light: red, green and blue. CIE 1931 xyz, The Mother of All Color Spaces \u00b6 The International Commission on Illumination (Commission Internationale de l'\u00c9clairage or CIE) is the world\u2019s authority on light. Under its auspices, a scheme was developed for modeling color, based upon human vision. The resulting CIE 1931 XYZ color space, an early attempt based on measurements of human color perception, is the basis for almost all other color spaces today. And that was in 1931 when there were no computers... RGB, the color space everybody knows \u00b6 sRGB was created in 1996 by HP and Microsoft for use on monitors, printers and the Internet. It\u2019s the default color space in all digital cameras and scanners as well as photo printing kiosk monitors, and may be the only color space supported by many of these devices. The RGB color space is normally shown graphically as RGB diagrams in which the amount of green is mapped along the one axis, the amount of red on another, and the amount of blue on a third, with saturation increasing outwards from the center. To fit three axes to a two-dimensional format, mathematicians have come up with a diagram that looks like the illustration below. Working with RGB however is rather difficult: as it is an additive method, it is hard to see from the hexadecimal value which color it is, how bright it is, and the lightness value. HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness/Luminance) are other methods to describe the color and are far easier to understand. Modeling the human eye \u00b6 sRGB is great for computers and photography, but it doesn't come close to predict how our eyes perceive hue, chroma and lightness. Don't use it for that! The CIE 1931 color model is from 1931, and was a first attempt to model the human color perception. Several models have replaced the original CIE xyz model to better model the human eyes. Different models are created for computers screens and things like print and paint. Our eyes are special. They can see many colors, but need a minimal color difference to recognize them as different colors. We also have different lightness and chroma (colorfulness) perception for different colors. All the newer models try to do a better job in modeling our eyes. CIELab, CIELuv and CAM16 are the best known among them. CIELuv is suited better for computers screens than CIELab, and CAM16 (from 2016) is the latest and greatest of the color space models. The CIEL* models also have a color wheel variant, comparable to HSB/HSL. It is called CIELch: Lightness, Chroma and Hue. Lightness is a percentage 0..100%, Chroma a variable number, and Hue the number of degrees (0..360\u00b0) in the color wheel. To give you an idea how these modern models perform, I included some screenshots. Hue linearity: diagrams should be balanced. Winner: CAM16 Color prediction: diagrams should be circles at best. Winner: CAM16 Lightness prediction: diagrams should follow the Fairchild-Chen data. Winner: CIELAB Conclusion \u00b6 So, none of them is perfect in predicting how hue, chroma and lightness are percieved. Now we know this, what is all the fuzz about Material 3? Why is Material 3 so different from Material 2? And why did I like it so much, that I wanted to use this for Home Assistant themes?","title":"Color Spaces"},{"location":"basics/color-spaces/#an-introduction","text":"To ensure you understand what Material 3 is all about, it helps to understand how color spaces work, as these are a very important part of Material 3.

Translating Material 3 color concepts... \u00b6 HAM3 makes explicit use of some great design considerations of the Material 3 color system. The main aspects are described below. Dynamic color Material 3 M3 Themes for HA The color system in M3 enables user preferences and needs to interact with an app\u2019s colors. Dynamic color specifically describes the convergence of user settings with the system UI and in-app color experiences One of the nicest things is that dynamic color allows the user to use an image as the basis for a theme. Material 3 generates a compatible theme from this. Design tokens & tool Material 3 M3 Themes for HA Design tokens enable flexibility and consistency across a product by allowing designers to assign an element's color role in a UI, rather than a set value. Tokens act as a bridge between an element's assigned role and the chosen color value for a role. With the addition of tokens, designing for relationships of elements is more fundamental than selecting specific colors HAM3 uses the Design tokens to generate the CSS color variables for the HA theme. As long as you use these CSS color variables in your cards, colors will follow the theme colors and behave as expected when switching between dark and light modes. HAM3 also maps the Material 3 colors to the existing M2 color names that Home Assistant uses to render the HAM3 theme by HA Accessibility Material 3 Home Assistant Dynamic color is designed to meet accessibility standards for color contrast. The system of tonal palettes is central to making any color scheme accessible by default. Combining color based on tonality, rather than hex value or hue, is one of the key systems that make any color output accessible. Products using dynamic color will meet requirements because the algorithmic combinations that an end-user can experience are designed to meet accessibility standards. Meeting accessibility standards for color contrast is one of the best features of Material 3. It allows HAM3 to create interchangeable dark and light themes without worrying about readability.

Home Assistant Material 3 Theme Template \u00b6 Github repository Since the HAM3 theme mainly maps Material 3 reference colors to system colors (light/dark independent) and existing Home Assistant theme settings, it is very easy to use a HAM3 theme template and only assign the generated Material 3 reference color definitions to add to an entirely new theme. Using a generic theme section where you just need to enter the Material 3 reference colors has proven to be very effective: I created the 7 dynamic theme samples in less than an hour.

As Google says: Dynamic color is designed to meet accessibility standards for color contrast. The system of tonal palettes is central to making any color scheme accessible by default. Combining color based on tonality, rather than hex value or hue, is one of the key systems that make any color output accessible. Products using dynamic color will meet requirements because the algorithmic combinations that an end-user can experience are designed to meet accessibility standards. As HCT uses the CIE-L* colorspace for lightness, lets see if what that does with a generated tonal palette. CIE L* lightness check... \u00b6 I took the C1 example and checked the lightness values. Color conversion using sRGB and CIE-Lab color hex m3 Lightness (sRGB-hsl) Lightness (CIE-Lch(ab)) Primary20 #68000a 20% hsl(354.2\u00b0, 100%, 20.3% ) lch( 19.9% , 49.3, 32.3\u00b0) Primary40 #bb1826 40% hsl(354.8\u00b0, 77.2%, 41.3% ) lch( 40.1% , 71.3, 31.3\u00b0) Secondary40 #775654 40% hsl(3.4\u00b0, 17.2%, 39.8% ) lch( 39.9% , 14.8, 26.1\u00b0) Tertiary40 #735b2e 40% hsl(39.1\u00b0, 42.8%, 31.5% ) lch( 40.1% , 29.5, 82.2\u00b0) Primary60 #ff5354 60% hsl(359.6\u00b0, 100%, 66.2% ) lch( 59.9% , 74.6, 29.5\u00b0) Primary80 #ffb3ac 80% hsl(5.0\u00b0, 100%, 83.7% ) lch( 79.9% , 30.5, 28.7\u00b0) Primary99 #fcfcfc 99% hsl(0\u00b0, 0%, 98.8% ) lch( 98.9% , 0.01, 296.8\u00b0) We see an exact match between the Material 3 lightness and the CIE-Lch(ab) lightness value for primary, secondary, and tertiary color palettes. You may also notice how the sRGB values \u200b\u200bare sometimes close and sometimes very different from these CIE values, which is why sRGB is not suitable for this kind of calculation. Material 3 is indeed using the CIE-L* colorspace to determine the lightness for tonal palettes Now let's take a look at the primary, secondary and tertiary palettes. Can we make sense of them? Primary palette \u00b6 Let's do some observations and look at the primary palette first! Experiment 1: how do primary palettes compare? \u00b6 Below you can see all primary pallets from the \"custom\" color examples. Please note that all x2%, x5% (except 95%), and x7% values \u200b\u200bdo not belong to the original Material 3 palette, but were added by me to have more tonal steps to work with. Some noticeable things from right to left: Some colors have less chroma/colorfulness in the darker areas than other colors: the red/blue/magenta show more chroma in darker tones than yellow/lime/green/cyan. There is a clear \"break\" visible at the 50%/60% tones: exactly the boundary between the dark and the light tones Another \"break\" is visible in many of the palettes between 80% and 90% (85% was added by me). Some of the colors are very colorful in the high lightness parts (say above 90%), and others are not. Especially the yellow, lime green/green, and cyan stand out. This is especially visible in the 99% lightness blocks. The above colors are visible, others are barely distinguishable. And that is to be expected, as these colors can have more chroma with high lightness values in the sRGB space when translated from CIE-L* space than the others. The following example shows this effect: yellow, green, and cyan are more colorful than any other color at higher lightness! Blue, purple, magenta, and red are much more subdued. The reverse is also valid: blue, purple, magenta, and red are more vibrant in darker tones. Note that dark orange with high chroma does not exist: that is what we call brown! The same is valid for yellow: mixing that color with black also turns brownish. Material 3 is palette calculations are again clearly using CIE-L*, but does NOT compensate for the colorful colors in the high lightness parts Experiment 2: what about palette hue? \u00b6 Since I couldn't find a CAM16 conversion table, I use CIE-Lch(ab) and CIE-Lch(uv) to check the tint values \u200b\u200bwith different lightness. The results are therefore less accurate but averaging the results should should make them usable compared to CAM16. If we look at the next table, we can see that Material 3 is not only varying lightness for the tonal palette but also varying both chroma and hue. As we have learned from the above observation, keeping the hue stable in the high lightness parts is difficult.

The slight differences in the lower lightness parts might be absent in CAM16. Secondary and Tertiary palette \u00b6 For starters, the \"normal\" way to choose a secondary or tertiary color is to move the color wheel a few degrees. The secondary color is usually a supporting color for the primary color, and the tertiary color more like an accent color. Experiment 3: Can we make sense of secondary and tertiary colors? \u00b6 I'm using CIE-LCh(uv) for this experiment. It's not very good at predicting chroma and hue, but maybe we can see something. Chroma is better than the Hue prediction. Using the mean values \u200b\u200band differences, the variations between CAM16 and CIE-LCh(uv) can be smoothed out. Secondary color palette: The hue value varies but stays close to the primary hue value with an average difference of 0.05\u00b0 (so nearly the same!). The chroma value seems to be very constant: ~20 for red and yellow, and around ~16 for the other colors. The chroma for the primary color has all sorts of values, so this can't be a coincidence. Tertiary color palette: The hue value hovers between 39\u00b0 and 83\u00b0 with an average of 61\u00b0 . The chroma value hovers between 21 and 38 with an average of: 28 .

And the HCT tertiary palette calculation: Hue is shifted 60\u00b0 from the primary color palette. The CIE-LCh(uv) averaged at 61\u00b0. Again pretty close! Chroma is fixed to 24 ! I got 28 from CIE-LCh(uv). CAM16 is much better for chroma.

Combining color based on tonality, rather than hex value or hue, is one of the key systems that make any color output accessible. Products using dynamic color will meet requirements because the algorithmic combinations that an end-user can experience are designed to meet accessibility standards.

Happy Theming!","title":" How to proceed"},{"location":"using/using-ham3-in-cards/","tags":["Themes","Colors"],"text":"How to use Material 3 themes \u00b6 Once you have installed one of the Material 3 themes, you can use all the color definitions the theme offers in your Home Assistant (custom) cards. To make full use of these theme color definitions, either the (custom) card itself should offer CSS styling functionality, or via a custom plugin that makes it possible to style parts of the card. Start to use the Theme color definitions! \u00b6 The key point in using all the features of the Home Assistant Material 3 themes is to use the theme color definitions whenever possible and appropriate. In that case, your card will follow the theme in both light and dark mode! Do Do'nt # Note: below is from Swiss Army Knife tool \"style\" YAML section style : fill : var(--primary-text-color) # Material text color stroke : var(--theme-sys-color-primary60) # M3 theme system color # Note: below is from Swiss Army Knife tool \"style\" YAML section style : fill : red # Hard coded red color stroke : #456712 # Hard coded hex color It can't get any easier Using theme definitions is not specific to the Material 3 themes: using them was already required for the light/dark themes to work I will use Teal Blue example theme D06 to show how you can use a Material 3 theme. The card shown is example 12 from the Swiss Army Knife custom card . The light variant. The dark variant. How to use the standard material colors \u00b6 The Material 3 themes map the color definitions to the standard Material Design color definitions Home Assistant is using . This means you can use the standard Material Design primary and secondary font and background colors as before to style your cards. If fonts use the var(--primary-text-color) CSS variable, both light and dark themes should work out of the box! For a list of used CSS variables by the Lovelace frontend of Home Assistant, look here The above example uses these default font and background colors for the cards background and text parts. How to define and use dedicated colors \u00b6 In some cases you can't use the Theme colors, you need to use dedicated colors. Traffic light colors or the Airvisual colors are a good example of that use case. You have 3 options to use dedicated colors in your cards: Use hard coded colors (HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.) Clone the theme you want to use, and define the colors in the theme, and use those custom color names in your cards. Say you define them as traffic-light-red : red traffic-light-yellow : yellow traffic-light-green : green You can use the colors in the card using the CSS variable var(--traffic-light-red) If the card is made with the Swiss Army Knife custom card , you can define those colors in the user CSS definitions, and use them in your card as CSS variables. The above example uses dedicated colors (green, yellow, orange, red, purple) for the AirVisual representation in the first wide card. AirVisual color definitions for Swiss Army Knife segmented arc tool 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 segments : colorstops : gap : 0.1 colors : 0 : '#A8E05F' # Green 51 : '#FDD74B' # Yellow 101 : '#FE9B57' 151 : '#FE6A69' 201 : '#A97ABC' 301 : '#A87383' styles : foreground : fill : darkgrey background : fill : var(--theme-sys-elevation-surface-neutral5) How to use the Material 3 colors \u00b6 The Material 3 themes define more colors : primary, secondary, tertiary and error reference and system color palettes and surface elevation colors. All these colors can be used as CSS variables. All Material 3 themes support light and dark mode. It does this by redefining the system colors with theme mode dependent reference colors. If you use Material 3 color names in your cards, non Material 3 themes will show fallback colors (mostly black and white) Material 3 System colors \u00b6 The Material 3 system colors are dependent of the theme mode (light or dark). Use this colors if you want to adapt the color to the theme mode. Light variant Dark variant Example d06, Teal Blue Light : Example d06, Teal Blue Dark : System colors are used throughout this example: The background of the circles use a surface system color: this color is darker than the background in a light theme, and lighter than the background in a dark theme. This surface color is also used in the half circle in the 'Hall' (4 th ) card, the circle around the icon in the 'Bedroom' (5 th ) card and the background of the first part of the \"Poseidon\" (7 th ) card. The same is done for the actual value of the circles: these use the primary dark variants in the light theme, and the light variants in the dark theme. The circles for battery and link quality use tertiary system colors. Check the Theme colors page for these system colors you can use.

Traffic light colors or the Airvisual colors are a good example of that use case. You have 3 options to use dedicated colors in your cards: Use hard coded colors (HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.) Clone the theme you want to use, and define the colors in the theme, and use those custom color names in your cards. Say you define them as traffic-light-red : red traffic-light-yellow : yellow traffic-light-green : green You can use the colors in the card using the CSS variable var(--traffic-light-red) If the card is made with the Swiss Army Knife custom card , you can define those colors in the user CSS definitions, and use them in your card as CSS variables. The above example uses dedicated colors (green, yellow, orange, red, purple) for the AirVisual representation in the first wide card.

This surface color is also used in the half circle in the 'Hall' (4 th ) card, the circle around the icon in the 'Bedroom' (5 th ) card and the background of the first part of the \"Poseidon\" (7 th ) card.
