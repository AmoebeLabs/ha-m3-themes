The `json2theme.py` script converts a .json file exported by the Material Theme Builder on Figma to a file that can be inserted in a Material 3 Theme for Home Assistant.

The output has to be inserted at the exact same position as with the other converter.

##Usage

`python json2theme.py exported.json converted.txt`
