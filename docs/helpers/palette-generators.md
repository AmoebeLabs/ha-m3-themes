##:sak-sak-logo: Color Designer to Create Tints and Shades
Color Designer is great for creating tints and shades, among a few other color combinations.

These tints and shades use the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) representation of the RGB color model. These are not fully accurate compared to the human perception of lightness. Use the previous one, the accessible palette generator for a better match!
