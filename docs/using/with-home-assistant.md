##:material-home-floor-3: Home Assistant's main UI

Material 3 for Home Assistant integrates M3 color definitions with the Home Assistant themes in a way that Home Assistant still uses the Material 2 definitions, including the dark and light theme modes.

Since the introduction of light and dark theme modes, the Home Assistant UI makes fully use of theme definitions. Therefore, and due to the mapping of M3 definitions to Material 2 definitions, an M3 based theme should integrate seemless with Home Assistant UI, but with all the possibilities M3 offers:

- Seemless compatibility between M3 themes
- Keeping readability between dark and light modes
- The ability to create a theme from your favorite picture

##:material-home-floor-3: Home Assistant built-in cards
As with the main UI, the built-in cards should integrate seemless with any HA M3 Theme.

!!! Warning "I did not test ALL the built-in cards, so there might still be some bugs present!"
