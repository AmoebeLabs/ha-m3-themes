##:material-home-floor-3: Home Assistant's main UI

Home Assistant has no idea that a Material 3 theme is used.
<br>Material 3 for Home Assistant integrates M3 color definitions with the Home Assistant themes by mapping the Material 2 and Home Assistant CSS definitions to the Material 3 definitions.

Since the introduction of light and dark theme modes, the Home Assistant UI makes full use of theme definitions. Therefore, and because of the mapping of M3 definitions to material 2 definitions, an M3 based theme should integrate seamlessly with the Home Assistant user interface, but with all the capabilities that M3 offers:

- Seemless compatibility between M3 themes
- Keeping readability between dark and light modes
- The ability to create a theme from your favorite picture

##:material-home-floor-3: Home Assistant built-in cards
As with the main UI, the built-in cards should integrate seamlessly with any HA M3 Theme.

!!! Warning "I did not test ALL the built-in cards, so there might still be some bugs present!"
