##:material-home-floor-3: Material 3 dynamic colors...

User-generated color schemes are an important feature of the M3 color system. The example below demonstrates how user-generated colors can be created and then manifest in a UI.

###:material-home-floor-3: Color from user wallpaper
A user’s wallpaper selection is the basis for the color extraction algorithm to build a color scheme that’s applied across a user's device and any apps that accept dynamic color.

A single source color is used to derive 5 tonal palettes that provide the basis for any light and dark theme use cases. Error colors are also slotted automatically, but are not technically included in the algorithmic extraction.

###:material-home-floor-3: From color extraction to color schemes
Given the tones that are derived from the wallpaper example above, tones are slotted into specific color roles that are mapped to Material components. 

A user-generated scheme produces the range of tones needed for both light and dark theme applications.
