Material 3 for Home Assistant integrates M3 color definitions with the Home Assistant themes in a way that Home Assistant still uses the Material 2 definitions, including the dark and light theme modes, but where cards can use all the possibilities M3 offers:

- Seemless compatibility between M3 themes
- Keeping readability between dark and light modes
- The ability to create a theme from your favorite picture

M3 Themes for Home Assistant extends and adapts the color definitions with more palettes, more surfaces, more color steps and reference color mapping to the dark and light themes without any changes in the cards.

Of course, your cards must use CSS theme variables and not fixed colors to get compliant light and dark color modes!
