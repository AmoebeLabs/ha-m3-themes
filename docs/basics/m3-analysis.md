##:material-home-floor-3: Material 3 analyzed...
Short analysis based on own knowledge, playing with Figma plugin and creating 22 examples using Material 3.

###:material-home-floor-3: Dynamic color

Picking a color from a picture is not that much of a deal. But calculating all the colors from one color is a very nice one. Altough from the examples and exeperiments the colors seem limited due to Accessibility standards.

###:material-home-floor-3: Design Tokens
Nice to introduce for Android.

Design tokens resemble CSS Variables. So really ease to implement using web standards...

###:material-home-floor-3: Accessibility

Biggest part to meet WCGA, limited colors, perceived color contrast and tonal lightness. --> LAB profile. LCH or AB ?

Unclear how secondary and tertiary colors are calculated. Not a fixed value along the HSV colorwheel. So I guess that that one also comes from LAB colorspace...

LCH is meant for computer screens??

Checking the tonal palettes from 0 to 100% --> percentage equals "L" from CIELab/Lch profiles!
