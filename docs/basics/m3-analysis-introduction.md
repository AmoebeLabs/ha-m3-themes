##:material-home-floor-3: Material 3 analyzed...

This chapter is all about some experiments to see if I can understand how Material 3 works, and if it does what it promises.

For this I used the 22 examples I made to analyse some of the Material 3 aspects.

From the examples, I can definately conclude that all themes with different colors give excellent views with consistent readability and contrast.

But on the other hand gave enough question marks on what Material 3 is doing in some cases.

Read on, if you're interested :smile:
