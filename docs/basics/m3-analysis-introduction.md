##:material-home-floor-3: Material 3 analyzed...

This chapter is about some experiments to see if I can understand how Material 3 works and if it does what it promises.

For this I used the 22 examples I created to analyze some of the Material 3 aspects.

From the examples, I can definitely conclude that all themes with different colors give excellent displays with consistent readability and contrast.

But then again, it raised enough questions about what Material 3 does in some cases.

Read on, if you're interested :smile:
