The Material 3 color system contains a few important new features. All these features are described on the [m3 website.](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/overview)

The most important aspects are described below.

| **Dynamic color**| .|
| ---- | ---- |
| The color system in M3 enables user preferences and needs to interact with an appâ€™s colors. <br><br>Dynamic color specifically describes the convergence of user settings with the system UI and in-app color experiences | ![dynamic color](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NGUL0eR9CX4ztNMVnfEoDODDlNqWKc0SzdKBIyzVNmPwmqwSRJj0gXXiM8f0TwUfnmWZiVreM9Vy-p_r8ThO2ThXVH1DJr_5s6L1V1J3pEnA=s0) |
| **Design tokens & tool** ||
| Design tokens enable flexibility and consistency across a product by allowing designers to assign an element's color role in a UI, rather than a set value.<br><br>Tokens act as a bridge between an element's assigned role and the chosen color value for a role. With the addition of tokens, designing for relationships of elements is more fundamental than selecting specific colors | ![tokens]( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6AeOFxLCf_u2S5X9xTe7BjB7f7-b8FN4ypCMoJKBO7eUTHjSkXqc0F1kykSBYwze9Rdn9-dggVszNj68iyciGH6z9qLXZbYF5gsDXUCncOfA=s0)|
| **Accessibility** ||
| Dynamic color is designed to meet accessibility standards for color contrast. The system of tonal palettes is central to making any color scheme accessible by default. <br><br>Combining color based on tonality, rather than hex value or hue, is one of the key systems that make any color output accessible. Products using dynamic color will meet requirements because the algorithmic combinations that an end-user can experience are designed to meet accessibility standards. | ![access]( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aF8CvgyX659D64Wim3zFsTgd63wXh1HBQ_XTyaMX6lARG7VEDkH-0KhmQmPgBOpqOwS6RMQZHRXUQ8qZITmaI4hF7vfexRA7kZhAAE61nd1Mxg=s0)|
