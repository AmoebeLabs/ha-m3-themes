#Getting started

Welcome to HAM3, the Material 3 Themes for Home Assistant documentation!

[Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) is the latest and greatest version of the Material Design language from Google:

!!! quote "Make personal devices feel personal with Material Design 3, Googleâ€™s most expressive and adaptable design system yet!"

##:material-home-floor-3: M3 or Material You

Material 3 is a common design language, with colors, typography, and UI elements for websites and Android.

The _You_ part refers to the fact that _You_ can now use a photo to create a theme!

The Material 3 Themes for Home Assistant or _HAM3_ will only use the color section and extend and adapt these guidelines to create Material 3 based themes for Home Assistant that should be [100% compatible][compatibility-section-md] with the currently used default day and night theme definitions.

##:material-home-floor-3: How to proceed

If you only want to use one of the available sample themes, go to [Installation][Material 3 theme installation]. You can check out the [examples section][examples-section-md] with 22 pre-made Material 3 based themes.

If you want to learn more, even design your own Material 3 themes and how to use them in Home Assistant, read more at [Material 3 Basics][basics-section-md], [using the Material 3 theme][using-section-md] and [Design Your Own Theme][design-section-md].
